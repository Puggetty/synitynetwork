Synity Network Development Page. This page is mainly for Puggetty's plugins.

## ModReq
ModReq is a plugin that allows players to send messages to all online moderators/admins. This is one of the first plugins I have developed so it is very simple :).

### Permissions:
modreq.receive - Allows a user to recieve a ModReq message

### Possible improvements:
I could add to this plugin by making it save all requests to a file and allowing an admin to read them at any time. Admins could set the state of a request to "Solved", "Working on", etc etc.

### Download
I'm not going to officially release the plugin as it is very simple, if you want to use it then you can download the jar from Modreq > target > ModReq.jar.

## CraftNameTag
CraftNametag is another simple plugin that really just does what is says on the tin. Players on the server requested it so I made it, it has nothing fancy just an extra crafting recipe.

### Improvements
You can see in the source code that a lot has been commented out. I am playing with getting the crafting table GUI up with the recipe displayed. I can do it but people can take the items and then it crashes the server. I just need to find a way to fix this.
~~It also uses a depreciated method, this needs to be changed.~~
Another thing I could do is allow the items to be changed in a config file.

### Download
Again, not releasing this but if you want it you can find it in CraftNametag > target > CNT.jar.
Or you could code it yourself, it's very easy.
