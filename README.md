## ModReq
ModReq is a plugin that allows players to send messages to all online moderators/admins. This is one of the first plugins I have developed so it is very simple :).

### Permissions:
modreq.receive - Allows a user to recieve a ModReq message

### Possible improvements:
I could add to this plugin by making it save all requests to a file and allowing an admin to read them at any time. Admins could set the state of a request to "Solved", "Working on", etc etc.

### Download
If you really want to use the plugin you can download the jar from Modreq > target > ModReq.jar.
